# ☔ RainWalk
This is a final project for the Geography Data Science course at NTNU.

## Objective
To help pedestrians find sheltered walking routes (arcades) in Taipei on rainy days.

## Features
- **Real-time Weather**: Connects to CWA API.
- **Arcade Navigation**: Visualizes arcade coverage in Daan District.
- **RainGo Integration**: Locates the nearest umbrella rental station.

## Limitations
- The routing algorithm currently prioritizes sheltered roads but may not always find the perfect connection due to OSM data limitations.
