# ☔ RainWalk
This is a final project for the Data Science and Computer Programming course at NTNU.

## Objective
To help pedestrians find sheltered walking routes (arcades) in Daan, Taipei on rainy days.

## Features
- **Real-time Weather**: Connects to CWA API.
- **Arcade Navigation**: Visualizes arcade coverage in Daan District.
- **RainGo Integration**: Locates the nearest umbrella rental station.

## Limitations
- The routing algorithm currently prioritizes sheltered roads but may not always find the perfect connection due to OSM data limitations.

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the **RainGo** team for providing the dataset of umbrella rental stations in Daan District. Their support made the "No Umbrella" navigation feature possible.
